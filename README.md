UART Transmission on Zynq-7000 FPGA
This repository contains Verilog code for implementing UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) transmission using the Zynq-7000 evaluation and development board. The design generates UART transmission at a baud rate of 9600, driven by a 100 MHz clock.

Features
Baud Rate Generation: Produces a baud rate of 9600 using clock division.
Transmission States:
Ready (rdy): Prepares for transmission when send signal is asserted.
Load Bit: Loads the next bit to be transmitted.
Send Bit: Transmits bits serially based on the baud rate clock.
Stop and Start Bits: Implements standard UART framing with start and stop bits.
Input/Output
Inputs
send: Signal to initiate the transmission.
clk: 100 MHz clock input.
Output
uart_tx: UART transmission signal.
Design Details
The design follows a state machine approach with three main states:

Ready (rdy): Waits for the send signal and initializes the UART transmission frame.
Load Bit: Loads the next bit from the transmission data (txData).
Send Bit: Transmits the bits serially at the specified baud rate.
Baud Rate Calculation
The baud rate divider is calculated as follows:

java
Copy code
Clock Frequency / Baud Rate = 100 MHz / 9600 â‰ˆ 10416  
Transmission Frame
The transmitted data includes a start bit (0), 8 data bits, and a stop bit (1).

How to Use
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>  
cd <repository-folder>  
Load the Verilog code onto your FPGA development environment (e.g., Vivado).
Configure the Zynq-7000 board with a 100 MHz clock source.
Connect the UART Tx line (uart_tx) to a UART receiver for testing.
Simulation and Testing
The design can be simulated using tools like Vivado or ModelSim to verify functionality. Connect the uart_tx line to a UART receiver or terminal to observe the transmitted data.
